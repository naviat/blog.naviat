Mailing Address

#### Level: Easy

#### Problem: 

Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address formatted in the manner that you would usually see it on the outside of an envelope. Your program does not need to read any input from the user.

#### Solution:

```
##
# Display a person's complete mailing address
#
print("Dam Van Hai")
print("Netcompany UK")
print("6 Floor, Mitec Tower")
print("Lo E2 Duong Dinh Nghe")
print("Cau Giay")
print("Hanoi")
```
